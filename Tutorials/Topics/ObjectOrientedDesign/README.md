# Object-Oriented Language Concepts - Java

Different examples for program design elated to object-oriented programming in java
## Classes
* Class examples
  * constructors
  * member methods and variables
  * constructor and method overloading
  * encapsultation
  * polymorphism (nominal typing)
  
## Reducing repeated code and re-using code through abstraction with classes

We can use the concept of abstractions to:

    * Re-use functionality
    * Remove duplicated logic


| Form        | By           | Abstraction               |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Inheritance | extending    | zero to one - super type  |
| Composition | implementing | zero to many - interfaces |
